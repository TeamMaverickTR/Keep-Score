# Keep-Score Developing an application called "Keep Score" for bowlers to track their frames can provide a convenient tool for both professional and recreational bowlers. The app should be designed to run on smart devices and offer an easy-to-use and straightforward experience. Here are the key aspects to consider when developing the "Keep Score" app:

    User Interface (UI): The user interface should be carefully designed to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience. Employ a visually appealing layout, selecting appropriate colors, fonts, and icons to enhance usability and readability.

    Frame Tracking: Implement a mechanism within the app to accurately record and display each frame. Each frame typically consists of two attempts to knock down the pins. Create a robust data structure that can efficiently store the score for each frame, including the number of pins knocked down on each attempt.

    Scoring Logic: Develop a reliable algorithm that adheres to the rules of bowling for calculating the score. Consider factors such as strikes, spares, and open frames when determining the cumulative score. It is essential to handle special cases, such as the 10th frame, which allows additional attempts.

    Input Mechanism: Provide a user-friendly input mechanism for bowlers to enter the number of pins knocked down in each attempt. This can be achieved through the implementation of buttons or a numerical keypad displayed on the screen. Validate the input to ensure it falls within the acceptable range of 0 to 10 pins.

    Scoreboard: Create a visually appealing and informative scoreboard that displays the current frame and the cumulative score. This feature enables bowlers to track their progress and assess their performance at a glance.

    Game Completion: Detect when the game reaches its conclusion, typically after ten frames, and display the final score to the bowler. Incorporate an option within the app to either start a new game or exit gracefully.

    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage exceptional cases, such as incorrect inputs or unexpected behavior. Display clear and concise error messages when necessary, guiding users to rectify any mistakes made.

    Persistence: Consider implementing data storage functionality within the app, allowing users to save and review their previous game scores. This feature enhances user engagement and enables them to track their progress over time.

    Testing and Optimization: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the app runs seamlessly on various smart devices and operating systems. Optimize the code for performance and efficient memory usage, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
